# Concept

- `Spanning Tree` of an undirected graph G is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of G, with a minimum possible number of edges.
  - There can be several spanning trees in a graph.
  - Spanning Tree does not have any cycle.
  - Number of edges in a spanning tree is (# of vertices - 1).
- `Minimum Spanning Tree, MST,` is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.
  - MST problem is finding the most inexpensive graph in an edge-weighted undirected graph.
