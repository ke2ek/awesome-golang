/*
Suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and indices in the text as their values.

The construction of such a tree for the string S takes time and space linear in the length of S.
Suffix trees also provide one of the first linear-time solutions for the longest common substring problem.

The suffix tree for the string S of length n is defined as a tree such that:
1. The tree has exactly n leaves numbered from 1 to n.
2. Except for the root, every internal node has at least two children.
3. Each edge is labelled with a non-empty substring of S.
4. No two edges starting out of a node can have string-labels beginning with the same character.
5. The string obtained by concatenating all the string-labels found on the path from the root to leaf i spells out suffix S[i..n] for i from 1 to n.

# of leaf nodes = M = the number of suffixes of a given string
# of non-leaf nodes <= M-1 (because an internal node of a suffix tree has at least 2 children)
# of total nodes <= 2M-1
So, space time complexity will be O(M).

Ideas:
1. This data structure starts from the idea that it reduce some paths without branching from a node to a leaf node
by each path which has only one edge.
	- Each label of edges, that are compressed, equals the concatenated edge labels from the node to the leaf node.
2. Labling edges as suffixes is not efficient because of storing strings,
so it will be better to label edges as (offset, length) pair which means the start index and the length of each suffix.
3. Each leaf node stores the start index of the suffix that the path represents.
4. Each leaf node means the end of substring(=$) because the tree needs to distinguish overlapping substrings.
	e.g., "abcd" and "ab" are on the same edge if there is no use of $.
	(Before)
	root - abcd$
	(After)
	root - ab - cd$
		  - $

How to build -> Ukkonenâ€™s Algorithm
1. Whenever adding a suffix to the tree, check if there is another suffix,
the prefix of which is the same as the suffix to be inserted.
2. If it exists, branch that node into two nodes, the node with $ (end of string) and the node with other letters,
where other letters are from the rest of the existing suffix except the prefix(=suffix to be inserted).
3. Suffix Links
e.g., one edge with path-label xA, where x is a character and A denotes substring, connects root node and ndoe W via node V
and another edge with path-label A connects node X and Y.
In this case, the edge going from node V to node X is so-called a suffix link.
	root --x-->  V --A--> W
	             | <<<<<<<<<<<<< this is a suffix link
	      ...  - X --A--> Y

If A is empty string, then a suffix link of that node will go to root node.
4. Edge-label Compression
