/*
Suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and indices in the text as their values.

Using Ukkonenâ€™s algorithm, the construction of such a tree for the string S takes time and space linear in the length of S.
Suffix trees also provide one of the first linear-time solutions for the longest common substring problem.

The suffix tree for the string S of length N is defined as a tree such that:
1. The tree has exactly n leaves numbered from 1 to N.
2. Except for the root, every internal node has at least two children.
3. Each edge is labelled with a non-empty substring of S.
4. No two edges starting out of a node can have string-labels beginning with the same character.
5. The string obtained by concatenating all the string-labels found on the path from the root to leaf i spells out suffix S[i..n] for i from 1 to n.

# of leaf nodes = M = the number of suffixes of a given string
# of non-leaf nodes <= M-1 (because an internal node of a suffix tree has at least 2 children)
# of total nodes <= 2M-1
So, space time complexity will be O(M).

Ideas:
1. This data structure starts from the idea that it reduce some paths without branching from a node to a leaf node
by each path which has only one edge.
	- Each label of edges, that are compressed, equals the concatenated edge labels from the node to the leaf node.
	e.g., Given a trie like "root --a--> node --b--> node --c--> node", it will be changed as "root --abc--> node"

2. Labling edges as suffixes is not efficient because of storing strings, so it will be better
to label edges as (start, end) pair which means the start index and the end index of each suffix.
	- The information about each edge will be stored in each node.
	e.g., If string S[x:y+1] is "abc", then "root --abc--> node" is gonna be "root --(x,y)--> node"

3. Each leaf node need to be the end of substring(=$) because the tree needs to distinguish overlapping substrings.
	e.g., Given a string "bcbc", substrings "bc" and "bc", where the first "bc" is in front of the second,
	are on the same edge if there is no use of $.

		(Before)
		root - bcbc$
		(After)
		root - bc - bc$
			  - $

How to build: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ukkonens-suffix-tree-construction-part-1/
Assume that we have a string S with the length N, where S has "$" at the end.
1. We will have N phases and, in each phase, we will process the prefix S[:i+1] (0 <= i < N).
2. Phase i will proceed at most i extentions, each of which will process the suffix of S[j:i+1] (0 <= j < i+1).
	- But, whenever one character is added, it doesn't have to visit all the characters of each suffix
	because of using information from the previous extentions in the current extention.
	- It will stores information like which node it should start from in each extention.
		- activeNode, activeEdge, and activeLength will be so useful that we can easily find it.
	- It will also stores information like where it should go to process remaining suffixes.
		- remainingSuffixCount, lastNewNode, and suffixLink will be so useful that we can easily move to another node.
	- There is also use a pointer variable to control all the leaf nodes at a time. => leafEnd
		- Once a leaf, always a leaf.
3. When S[j:i+1] is inserted into a suffix tree, we will follow as like below:
	- Extention Rule 1. if there is S[j:i] on the tree and S[i-1] is the last character of this edge, then just add.
		- Addition will be done by increasing the end index of all the leaf nodes by 1. So, it will take O(1).
	- Extention Rule 2. if there is S[j:i] on the tree and S[i] is not the same as the next character of this edge,
	then it will branch that node into two nodes, where one is a existing leaf node(A) representing a substring
	starting from S[i-1] of that edge and another is a new leaf node(B) representing only S[i].
	Also, that branched node will become a new internal node representing S[j:i].
		- In this case, lastNewNode will be changed as a new internal node.
	- Extention Rule 3. if there is S[j:i] on the tree and S[i] is the next character of this edge, there's nothing to do.
		- In this case, remainingSuffixCount won't be decreased.
4. Suffix Links: one edge with path-label xA, where x is a character and A denotes substring, connects root node and
ndoe W via node V and another edge with path-label A connects node X and Y.
The edge going from node V to node X is so-called a suffix link.

	root --x-->  V --A--> W
	             | <<<<<<<<<<<<< this is a suffix link
	      ...  - X --A--> Y

If A is empty string, then a suffix link of that node will go to root node.
This can be useful to find each internal node to process the next suffix by O(1).
5. Keep in mind: all the subtrees of internal nodes connecting with suffix links are the same tree structure.
	- each edge label of one subtree is the same as the label of another that the subtree is linking.

N-1   N-1-i      N-1-j    0  => Reverse Index (of R)
 |------|----------|------|
 0      i          j     N-1 => Forward Index (of S)
        <---------->
           L=j+1-i

If S[i:i+L] is palindromic, then it will satisfy the following conditions:
1. A character with index i (forward index) in a string S of length N, will be at index N-1-i (reverse index)
in itâ€™s reversed string R.
2. If there is a common substring of length L at indices Si (forward index) and Ri (reverse index) in S and R,
then these will come from same position in S if Ri = (N â€“ 1) â€“ (Si + L â€“ 1) where N is string length.
i.e. if substring in S is at index Si, then same substring should be in R at index (N â€“ 1) â€“ (Si + L â€“ 1).
3. all leaf nodes will have one forward or reverse index depending on which string (S or R) they belong to.
Then childrenâ€™s forward or reverse indices propagate to the parent.

In summary, when "S#R$" is added into a suffix tree, a common substirng of S and R is represented on the same internal nodes.
After forward/reverse indices are propagated from children to their own parent, an internal node representing palindromic substring
has Si and Ri which satisfy that Ri = (N-1) - (Si+L-1), where L is the length of substring.
because a reverse index means the start index of a suffix and, if it is Ri like above, a common substring in R and S
must be from same position in S. (e.g. S[Si:Si+L] == R[Ri:Ri+L])

Given a string S="cabbaabb", we can see like below:

c a b b a a b b = R
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 = Ri
c a b b a a b b = S
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 = Si

Si = 4, L = 4 -> S[4:8]="aabb" (j=i+L-1=4+4-1=7)
Is it palindromic? No.

N-1-j = 8-1-7 = 0
N-1-i = 8-1-4 = 3

R[0:4]="bbaa" != S[4:8]="aabb"

If R[0:4] were "aabb", an internal node representing "aabb" would have Si with 4 and Ri with 0 (=(8-1)-(4+4-1)).
RE: Ri = (N â€“ 1) â€“ (Si + L â€“ 1), which means the start index of a common substring in R (=reversed a common substring of S).
